title: Picking a Runtime
---

assistant-ui offers a variety of runtimes for different use cases.

## New Chatbot

The following runtimes are recommended for new apps:

- [AI SDK](/docs/runtimes/ai-sdk/use-chat)
- [LangGraph Cloud](/docs/runtimes/langgraph)

### Vercel AI SDK

AI SDK by Vercel lets you build conversational AI agents.

### LangGraph Cloud

The LangGraph Cloud runtime lets you build stateful agents with LangGraph.

## Already using a custom backend

For custom backends, we have two entrypoints for integration:

- [LocalRuntime](/docs/runtimes/custom/local)
- [ExternalStoreRuntime](/docs/runtimes/custom/external-store)

## Updates

The useRemoteThreadListRuntime function has been updated to support generic types. This means that the function can now accept and return any type that extends the AssistantRuntime type. This allows for more flexibility and type safety when using the function.

Here is the updated function signature:

```typescript
export const useRemoteThreadListRuntime = <T extends AssistantRuntime>(
  options: RemoteThreadListOptions<T>,
): T => {
  const [runtime] = useState(() => new RemoteThreadListRuntimeCore(options));
  useEffect(() => {
    runtime.threads.__internal_setOptions(options);
    runtime.threads.__internal_load();
  }, [runtime, options]);
  return useMemo(() => AssistantRuntimeImpl.create(runtime) as T, [runtime]);
};
```

This change affects the following files:

- AssistantRuntimeProvider.tsx
- AssistantContext.ts
- index.ts
- RemoteThreadListHookInstanceManager.tsx
- RemoteThreadListThreadListRuntimeCore.tsx
- types.tsx
- useRemoteThreadListRuntime.tsx

Please refer to the code changes for more details.
