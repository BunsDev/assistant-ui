title: Attachments
---

Allow the user to attach files to their messages.

## Enabling attachments

In order to enable attachments, you need to pass a `AttachmentAdapter` to your runtime hook, e.g. `useChatRuntime`/`useLangGraphRuntime`/`useExternalStoreRuntime`/...

In this example, we use a `CompositeAttachmentAdapter` that allows the user to attach images and text.
The CompositeAttachmentAdapter allows you to combine multiple attachment adapters into one.

```tsx title="/app/MyRuntimeProvider.tsx"
import { useChatRuntime } from "@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk";
import {
  CompositeAttachmentAdapter,
  SimpleImageAttachmentAdapter,
  SimpleTextAttachmentAdapter,
} from "@assistant-ui/react";

const runtime = useChatRuntime({
  api: "/api/chat",
  adapters: {
    attachments: new CompositeAttachmentAdapter([
      new SimpleImageAttachmentAdapter(),
      new SimpleTextAttachmentAdapter(),
    ]),
  },
});
```

## Changes in Import Statements

The order of import statements in `ThreadMessageLike.tsx` has been changed. This change does not affect the functionality of attachments. The import statements are now organized in a way that groups similar types together.

```tsx
import {
  CompleteAttachment,
  FileContentPart,
  ImageContentPart,
  MessageStatus,
  TextContentPart,
  ThreadAssistantContentPart,
  ThreadAssistantMessage,
  ThreadMessage,
  ThreadSystemMessage,
  ThreadUserContentPart,
  ThreadUserMessage,
  UIContentPart,
  Unstable_AudioContentPart,
} from "../../types";
import { ReasoningContentPart, ThreadStep } from "../../types/AssistantTypes";
```

## Message Role Update

The `MessageRole` type has been updated to include a new role: "data". This change does not affect the functionality of attachments but provides more flexibility in defining the role of a message.

```tsx
export type MessageRole = "user" | "assistant" | "system" | "data";
```

Please note that these changes do not require any modifications to the way attachments are handled in your application.
