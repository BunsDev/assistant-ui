The `TextContentPartProvider` provides data and APIs for `TextContentPart` components.

This is useful if you want to reuse the same `Text` component outside of a message text, e.g. with the `@assistant-ui/react-markdown` package.

```tsx {1, 8, 10}
import { AssistantRuntimeProvider } from "@assistant-ui/react";

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <TextContentPartProvider text={"Hello!"}>
      <MyMarkdownText />
    </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
  );
};
```

#### Code changes

The code changes include modifications to the `TextContentPart` type, which may affect how text content parts are provided or represented in the system. The `role` property of `ThreadMessageLike` type has been updated to include a new role "data". The `MessageRole` type in `AssistantTypes.ts` has also been updated to include this new role. 

The order of import statements in `ThreadMessageLike.tsx` has been rearranged, but this does not affect the functionality of the code. 

In `AssistantTypes.ts`, the `CoreToolCallContentPart` and `ToolCallContentPart` types have been updated to extend `ReadonlyJSONObject` instead of being equal to it. This change provides more flexibility in the type of arguments (`TArgs`) that can be passed to these types.

Please note that these changes may require updates to any components or systems that interact with these types.
