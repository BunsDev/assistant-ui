title: Thread Width
---

You can modify the max width of the thread via the CSS variable `--aui-thread-max-width`. This variable affects all thread-related components, including:
- Thread viewport and footer
- Thread welcome screen
- User messages
- Assistant messages
- Edit composer
- Message attachments

## Wider Thread

```css title="@/app/globals.css"
:root {
  --aui-thread-max-width: 600px;
}
```

## Take up the whole screen

```css title="@/app/globals.css"
:root {
  --aui-thread-max-width: infinity;
}
```

The width setting is consistently applied across all thread components to maintain a uniform layout throughout the conversation interface.
